<div><b>General informations</b><br />
The database is structured as a tree to allow complete flexibility in the types of process flows that can be logged.<br />Each entry is called a <b>Node</b> and to each Node is associated a <b>Type</b>. Nodes can be freely moved up and down or across the tree hierarchy to represent correctly the flow of operations.<br />Each type contains specific <b>fields</b> which may be the parameters of a process, links to images or external files, a block of text like the one you are reading, and almost any conceivable form of data you may want to save.<br />Nodes can be copied and pasted allowing to quickly replicate a previous entry with only some minor modifications (e.g. changing just one parameter between two otherwise identical experiments)<br /><br />To edit fields, use the <i>Data Edit</i> tab on the bottom of this screen, to see properly formatted <b>output</b> use instead the <i>Data Output</i> tab.<br /><br />Several customizations and options can be found under the <u>Tools</u> menu. For instance you may be wanting to set the European date format in <i>General Options</i> as %d/%m/%y.<br />This template is typically intended to be used with <i>Show Output Descendants</i> enabled under the <u>View</u> menu or on the menu bar.<br /><br />Finally, in case of IP concerns, the file can be password protected from File -&gt; Properties<br /><br />
<b>Journals</b><br />
Journals allow to write down any kind of general text related or unrelated to the samples in the database.<br />A Journal can contain any amount of pages of <u><i>formatted</i></u> text as well as link to other database <a href="#b4026def878b11edb00fc7f3b7147ef6">entries</a> or external files or <a href="https://www.polifab.polimi.it">webpages</a>.<br />Formatting, links and other useful functions are accessible by mouse right-click while editing the "Text" field.<br /><br />Beside <b>Page</b><u>,</u> another data type already provided is <b>Image</b> which allows to display in line an <a href="#1f1b286fb53611edb6e0d319a877bc10">image</a> with the relative caption.<br /><br />
<b>Samples</b><br />
You can organize samples in different sample families. According to the needs, a sample familily can be the container of all the samples of a project or represent a physical storage box.<br />Samples can be either <a href="#5a49aa5bb50711ed8c37d319a877bc10">wafers</a> or <a href="#a81fb188b51011eda053d319a877bc10">pieces</a> (dices) Each sample will then continue any number of processes ordered chronologically.<br /><br />

<b>Processes</b><br />
<br />A list of default processes is already in this file. Ready to copy entries are in <a href="#1c059884b51a11eda830d319a877bc10">process examples</a><br />First level processes include Lithography, Thermal treatments, Metrology steps, Etch, Depositions... For substeps or large tables of parameters a second level of depth is added in the hierarchy.<br />This can be the example of the parameters of individual al layers in a depostion or of spin coating in a lithographic process.<br />Data Types can be customized according to the need and new ones can be added.<br /><br /><br />

<b>Notes</b><br />
As in the image above, notes can be attached everywhere (processes, samples, containers...) like sticky notes. With the relevant difference that sticky notes are not cleanroom compatible.<br />The field "NoteType" allows you to give a visual feeback of what the note contains both in the output color and icons.<br /><br />
<div>Generic Note<br />
<p style="color:#55AA22";>Success</p><br />
<p style="color:#EE7700";>Warning</p><br />
<p style="color:#FF0000";>Failure</p><br /><br /></div>
<b>Files</b><br />
In the same way of notes, a <u>File</u> node can be attached to any other element. These nodes contain just an external link to a file (or a folder if edited accordingly) in relative or abolute path. The choice of absolute or relative paths should be consistent in all the entries; a relative path is advised if the database and relative files are shared among more people or could be moved to a different path at a later stage.<br /><br />
<b>Numerical and boolean tag</b><br />
A convenient way to add a relevant quantitative information that is not already part of a node is to attach a <u>Numerical tag</u> child to it. In the same way a <u>Boolean tag</u> can store yes/no conditions. These tags can still be then used for filtering or searching samples based on matching conditions. A typical use case is the enormous set of metrology and characterization you may run. Instead of creating one type for each characterization you can use tags to build up a custom metrology entry with the relevant informations stored as child nodes. <br />Of course, if you are going to run always the same characterizations producing consistent outputs, you can define a specific data type as described in <a href="#486de0b5b5e111ed99edd319a877bc10">Editing Data Structure</a> to include it in the first place.<br /><br />Note: numerical tags can accept inputs in scientific notation (e.g. 1e-5) but will immediately convert and display it in decimal notation (i.e. 0.00001). If found necessary, a data type with output in scientific notation can be easily added. Nevertheless, data are always stored as decimal behind the courtains and all conditions on values for searching/filtering the database should be written with decimal notation only.<br /><br />

<b>Clones</b><br />
As it is often the case, a sample can be cut to proceed with a split process on different dices.<br />To handle this in the best way you can have <b>both</b> a copy inside the parent wafer and a <i>clone</i> as a new sample.<br />The recomended procedure is the following as done with examples <a href="#888e1f73b5c511ed8981d319a877bc10">Wafer25</a> and <a href="#bc5786a2b51d11edb8c3d319a877bc10">W25D1</a>.<br /><br /><br />1- Log the <a href="#ec106aa7b51c11ed9ed1d319a877bc10">dicing process</a> performed and define parts name under it<br />2- Clone (Copy and Edit -&gt; Paste cloned child) the dices that go on with processing on the sample familiy where they belong<br /><br />Every modification made to one of the clones and its children will be automatically reflected on the other.<br />Clones appear in both their path in the top bar (a.k.a. breadcrumb view).<br /><br />Batch processes regarding multiple samples at once can be cloned as well in the same way.<br /><br />
