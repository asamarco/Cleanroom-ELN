<div><b>Usage</b><br />
The database is structured as a tree to allow complete flexibility in the types of process flows that can be logged.<br />Each entry is called a <b>Node</b> and to each Node is associated a <b>Type</b>. Nodes can be freely moved up and down or across the tree hierarchy to represent correctly the flow of operations.<br />Each type contains specific <b>fields</b> which may be the parameters of a process, links to images or external files, a block of text like the one you are reading, and almost any conceivable form of data you may want to save.<br />Nodes can be copied and pasted allowing to quickly replicate a previous entry with only some minor modifications (e.g. changing just one parameter between two otherwise identical experiments)<br /><br />To edit fields, use the <i>Data Edit</i> tab on the bottom of this screen, to see properly formatted <b>output</b> use instead the <i>Data Output</i> tab.<br /><br />Several customizations and options can be found under the <u>Tools</u> menu. For instance you may be wanting to set the European date format in <i>General Options</i> as %d/%m/%y.<br />This template is typically intended to be used with <i>Show Output Descendants</i> enabled under the <u>View</u> menu or on the menu bar.<br /><br />Finally, in case of IP concerns, the file can be password protected from File -&gt; Properties<br /><br />
<b>Journals</b><br />
Journals allow to write down any kind of general text related or unrelated to the samples in the database.<br />A Journal can contain any amount of pages of <u><i>formatted</i></u> text as well as link to other database <a href="#b4026def878b11edb00fc7f3b7147ef6">entries</a> or external files or <a href="https://www.polifab.polimi.it">webpages</a>.<br />Formatting, links and other useful functions are accessible by mouse right-click while editing the "Text" field.<br /><br />Beside <b>Page</b><u>,</u> another data type already provided is <b>Image</b> which allows to display in line an <a href="#1f1b286fb53611edb6e0d319a877bc10">image</a> with the relative caption.<br /><br />
<b>Samples</b><br />
You can organize samples in different sample families. According to the needs, a sample familily can be the container of all the samples of a project or represent a physical storage box.<br />Samples can be either <a href="#5a49aa5bb50711ed8c37d319a877bc10">wafers</a> or <a href="#a81fb188b51011eda053d319a877bc10">pieces</a> (dices) Each sample will then continue any number of processes ordered chronologically.<br /><br />

<b>Processes</b><br />
<br />A list of default processes is already in this file. Ready to copy entries are in <a href="#1c059884b51a11eda830d319a877bc10">process examples</a><br />First level processes include Lithography, Thermal treatments, Metrology steps, Etch, Depositions... For substeps or large tables of parameters a second level of depth is added in the hierarchy.<br />This can be the example of the parameters of individual al layers in a depostion or of spin coating in a lithographic process.<br />Data Types can be customized according to the need and new ones can be added.<br /><br /><br />

<b>Notes</b><br />
As in the image above, notes can be attached everywhere (processes, samples, containers...) like sticky notes. With the relevant difference that sticky notes are not cleanroom compatible.<br />By choosing the appropriate icon field you can make a visual feeback of what the note contains<br /><br />
<div>


<br /></div>
<b>Files</b><br />
In the same way of notes, a <u>File</u> node can be attached to any other element. These nodes contain just an external link to a file (or a folder if edited accordingly) in relative or abolute path. The choice of absolute or relative paths should be consistent in all the entries; a relative path is advised if the database and relative files are shared among more people or could be moved to a different path at a later stage.<br /><br />
<b>Numerical and boolean tags</b><br />
A convenient way to add a relevant quantitative information that is not already part of a node is to attach a <u>Numerical tag</u> child to it. In the same way a <u>Boolean tag</u> can store yes/no conditions. These tags can still be then used as for filtering or searching samples based on matching conditions. A typical example is the enormous set of metrology and characterization you may run. Instead of creating one type for each characterization you can build with set for each node the relevant informations using tags <br />Of course, if you are going to run always the same characterizations producing consistent outputs, you can define a specific data type as described in <a href="#486de0b5b5e111ed99edd319a877bc10">Editing Data Structure</a> to include it in the first place.<br /><br />

<b>Clones</b><br />
As it is often the case, a sample can be cut to proceed with a split process on different dices.<br />To handle this in the best way you can have <b>both</b> a copy inside the parent wafer and a <i>clone</i> as a new sample.<br />The recomended procedure is the following as done with examples <a href="#5a49aa5bb50711ed8c37d319a877bc10">Wafer1</a> and <a href="#bc5786a2b51d11edb8c3d319a877bc10">W1D1</a>.<br /><br /><br />1- Log the <a href="#ec106aa7b51c11ed9ed1d319a877bc10">dicing process</a> performed and define parts name under it<br />2- Clone (Copy and Edit -&gt; Paste cloned child) the dices that go on with processing on the sample familiy where they belong<br /><br />Every modification made to one of the clones and its children will be automatically reflected on the other.<br />Clones appear in both their path in the top bar (a.k.a. breadcrumb view).<br /><br />Batch processes regarding multiple samples at once can be cloned as well in the same way.<br /><br />

<div><b>Data Types</b><br />
The data structure is completely configurable, after you get familiar with the examples, you can modify and/or add data types with Data -&gt; Configure Data Types according to your needs.<br />Please refer to the documentation for more details on Data Types, configuration of fields and outputs. The complete Treeline manual can be found under the Help menu.<br /><br />Some suggestions to maintain consistency in modified databases:<br /><br />1) Icons if possible should keep<br /><br /><b>+</b> for additive process<br /><b>-</b> for removal process<br /><br /><span style="color:#0000ff">Blue</span> = metals<br /><span style="color:#ff0000">Red</span> = oxides<br /><span style="color:#005500">Green</span> = semiconductors/nitrides/sulfides/others<br /><br />2) The Data type should follow a naming like<br /><br />X_NameOfNewType<br /><br />where X:<br /><br />C: Container (Journals, Samples)<br />S: Sample (Wafer,Dice)<br />G: Generic (Page, Image, Note, File) <br /><br />First level process:<br />P: Process<br />M: Metrology<br /><br />Second level process:<br />D for Deposition<br />L for Lithography<br />E for Etch<br />...<br /><br /><b>Important:</b> Even though treeline does not really force any strong restriction it is a good practice to set legitimate Child Type Limits (in Type config, under advanced options). For example if you create a new process you will have to add it as legitimate for Wafers and/or Dices. See image below.<br /><br /><br /><br />
